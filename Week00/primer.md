## UD Software Primer
A Workshop for Incoming Urban Design Students
Friday, June 3, 2-6 pm, Avery 700


The urban design software primer establishes a common starting point for all new urban design students. The primer is intended to inform and guide students of various backgrounds and disciplines through widely used software and efficient workflows catered to available technologies at GSAPP. The Digital Techniques course faculty have developed a series of mini lessons to demonstrate the software skills that you are expected to utilize and advance to support your graduate study. This workshop is an opportunity to jump start your graduate year to learn or affirm you digital skills; pick up on terminology to share a common technical language; and to comprehend workflows and project setups for group work. Three primer lessons present a sequenced experience of how Photoshop, Illustrator and Rhino can be efficiently used together for graphic representation. Live instruction lessons in a lab format will also include reference resources to expand upon the concepts beyond the primer.  Advanced software users are encouraged to explore this option to approach the lessons with more rigor. This introductory workshop welcomes you to ramp up, recall and assess your software skills. Get familiar with: GSAPP resources by “doing”; your faculty team by asking questions; and your peers by engaging with them as you work through the primer exercises. 

By the end of this workshop you should understand how to:

* make a drawing using a Rhino > Illustrator > Photoshop pipeline
* move into editing and refinement mode
* organize your modeling environment for co-creation
* set up your work for collaboration
* share assets across different programs
* know where to look for technical support
